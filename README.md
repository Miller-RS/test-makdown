# Learn to represent the Knowledge

**what is a Agent?**

********what are the components of the architecture of agents? define each one******** 

**what is rationality?**

**what are the components that should have a IA system?**

**An AI system can only have one type of agent?**

# 1. Agents

A agent is a human, software, hardware that act upon its environment. The goal of the agents is in its environment.

## 1.1 Structure of a Agent

Agent = Architecture + program 

- Architecture: is the hardware components like sensors, memory, CPU and so on.
- Program: is where the IA acts, it is the software, algorithms, code and so on that govern its behavior.

**Example of identify the agents and its environment**

************************Example of Agents in the real life.************************

- Chat bots
- Virtual Assistants: Siri, Cortana, Alexa and so on
- Autonomous Robots
- Fraud detection agents: Banks and financial institutions(JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank â€¦.) use agents to detect fraudulent activity by monitoring transactions and flagging suspicious behavior.
- Traffic control agents: Traffic control systems can use agents to manage the flow of traffic by adjusting traffic lights and routing vehicles to reduce congestion.

# 2.Rationality

According to Herbert Simon the optimal rationality is different to ideal rationality because a agent is limited of his architecture.

The optimal rationality is according that sensors, memory and so on of a agents to determined goal.  

# 3. Components of IA system

An IA system should have a combination of this concept to achieve the goals but it could have one or more of this concepts. 

- Omniscience:  the real omniscience(know all is impossible until now ), a IA system should have a gradual level of omniscience because we the humans canâ€™t analyze a lot amount of data, we need to analyze data for find patterns, diagnostic and so on.
- Learning: an AI system learn of data and improve their task.
- Autonomy: an AI system operate without human interventional

# 4. Type of Agents

A agent can have a combination of this types or only one:

- Simple reactive agents: this agents act according only perceive of their environment(have rule for this perceives) , donâ€™t have memory, state.
- Deliberative agents: reason about their actions and plan for the future, have a internal model of the environment  to make decision and can consider multiple course of action.
- Hybrid agents: Simple reactive agents + Deliberative agents.
- Model-based reactive agents: These agents use internal models of the environment to make decisions based on current condition. They can update their models over time as they learn more about the environment.
- Goal-based agents: These agents have a set of goals. They use internal models of the environment to plan and take actions that move them closer to their goals.
- Utility-based agents: These agents use utility or value functions to evaluate different actions and choose the one that maximizes their expected outcome.
- Learning agents: These agents have the ability to learn from their experiences and improve their decision-making over time. They can adapt to changing environments and improve their performance through trial and error.

# 5. Problem Resolution

The goal is that a program can solve problems. We must define any type of problem according to can solve automatically.

what we need?

1. A common representation for all problems
2. Algorithms that use a strategy to solve problems defined with 1
